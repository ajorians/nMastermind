nMastermind

About:
This is a game for the TI-nSpire!  It works on the TI-NSpire CX with ndless 3.1 or ndless 3.6 and should work on all of the TI-nspire models.  The goal is to figure out what colors and in what order have been choosen.  You do this with making decisive attempts.  Each time you'll receive some number of black and white indicators.  Black indicators means a peg is the correct color and in the correct position.  White means it is the correct color but not in the correct position.  Based on this you have a limit number of tries to figure out the colors and order.  I hope you enjoy it!

How to put on calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-drop the nMastermind-sdl.tns file into the application to transfer it to your calculator.  You have to have ndless 3.1 or ndless 3.6 on your calculator in order to run it!

How to play:
Navigate the menu using the arrow keys (or 2 and 8 keys) and the Enter key to start a new game.
Use the arrow keys (or 2, 4, 6 and 8 keys) to move and cycle through the colors.
Press the Enter key when you are ready to find out what indicators you get.

Extra:
For added fun you can change the number of holes, colors and tries!
